# Private API

:::{warning}
The private API pages reference parts of the PyMC API that are developer
facing only but still benefit from having their docstrings rendered here
to help both contributors and members of the PyMC team.

If you are a PyMC user you should try to avoid using these objects.
As part of the private API, their changes may not appear in the release
notes and they can be modified or removed without warning at any time.
