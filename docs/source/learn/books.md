## Bayesian Methods for Hackers

By Cameron Davidson-Pilon

The "hacker" in the title  means learn-as-you-code. This hands-on introduction teaches intuitive definitions of the Bayesian approach to statistics, worklflow and decision-making by applying them using PyMC.

## Bayesian Analysis with Python

By Osvaldo Martin

A great introductory book written by a maintainer of PyMC. It provides a hands-on introduction to the main concepts of Bayesian statistics using synthetic and real data sets. Mastering the concepts in this book is a great foundation to pursue more advanced knowledge.

## Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python

By Osvaldo Martin, Ravin Kumar and Junpeng Lao

Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python aims to help beginner Bayesian practitioners to become intermediate modelers. It uses a hands on approach with PyMC and ArviZ focusing on the practice of applied statistics with references to the underlying mathematical theory.
