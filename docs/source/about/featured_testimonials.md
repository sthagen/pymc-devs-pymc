> PyMC is my primary tool for statistical modeling at Salesforce. I use it to combine disparate sources of information and pretty much anywhere that quantifying uncertainty is important. We've also been experimenting with gaussian processes to model time series data for forecasting.

> At the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, we use PyMC for a wide variety of scientific and business use cases. The API is incredible, making it easy to express probabilistic models of our scientific experimental data and business processes, such as models of electrophysiology and molecular dose response.
