:::{card} Announcements: library name change and launching PyMC 4.0!
:width: 75%
:margin: auto

We have two major announcements that we're excited to share. First of all, a new name for our library: the PyMC3 library you know and love is now called PyMC. PyMC3 still exists, as a specific major release between PyMC2 and PyMC 4.0. Read more about the renaming and how to solve related issues you might experience from this update [here]().

This ties into our second announcement, which is that we are hereby launching the newest version of PyMC: PyMC 4.0! Read more about this new release [here]().

:::{grid-item}

**Friendly modelling API**

PyMC allows you to write down models using an intuitive syntax to describe a data generating process.
:::
:::{grid-item}

**Cutting edge algorithms and model building blocks**

Fit your model using gradient-based MCMC algorithms like NUTS, using ADVI for fast approximate inference — including minibatch-ADVI for scaling to large datasets — or using Gaussian processes to build Bayesian nonparametric models.

    import pymc as pm

    X, y = linear_training_data()
    with pm.Model() as linear_model:
        weights = pm.Normal("weights", mu=0, sigma=1)
        noise = pm.Gamma("noise", alpha=2, beta=1)
        y_observed = pm.Normal(
            "y_observed",

            sigma=noise,
            observed=y,
        )

        prior = pm.sample_prior_predictive()
        posterior = pm.sample()
        posterior_pred = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(posterior)
