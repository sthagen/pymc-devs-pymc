    expand: bool, optional
        If True, `new_size` is prepended to the existing distribution `size`, so that
        the final size is equal to (*new_size, *dist.size). Defaults to false.

    Returns
    -------
    A new distribution variable that is equivalent to the original distribution with
    the new size. The new distribution will not reuse the old RandomState/Generator
    input, so it will be independent from the original distribution.

    --------

        new_x = change_dist_size(x, new_size=(5, 3), expand=False)

        new_x = change_dist_size(x, new_size=(5, 3), expand=True)
